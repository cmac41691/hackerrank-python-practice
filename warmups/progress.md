## Earlier Progress (Initial Warmups)

- Completed early HackerRank Python warmup challenges
- Focused on input/output, arithmetic, conditionals, and loops
- Built habit of solving → reflecting → committing

## 2025-12-31
### Solved
- Python Division

### Concepts Reinforced
- Difference between integer division (`//`) and float division (`/`)
- Reading multiple inputs from STDIN
- Printing results on separate lines as required by the judge

### Notes
- In Python 3, `/` always returns a float.
- `//` performs floor (integer) division.
- Understanding operators prevents silent logic bugs.
## 2026-01-01

### Solved
- Python Loops

### Concepts Reinforced
- Using `range(n)` to iterate from 0 to n-1
- For-loop iteration
- Calculating squares with multiplication
- Printing output line-by-line for judges

### Notes
- `range(n)` excludes `n` by design.
- Each loop iteration maps directly to one output line.
- Googling syntax is part of real-world problem solving.


## 2026-01-02

### Solved
- Write a Function (Leap Year)

### Concepts Reinforced
- Defining and returning values from functions
- Boolean logic with multiple conditional branches
- Using modulo (`%`) for divisibility checks
- Early returns to simplify logic
- Translating real-world rules into code

### Notes
- Order of conditions matters when rules overlap.
- `return` exits the function immediately.
- Writing readable conditionals prevents logical bugs.
- This problem mirrors real business-rule logic.



## 2026-01-03

### Solved
- List Comprehensions (3D Coordinates)

### Concepts Reinforced
- Nested iteration using list comprehensions
- Mapping multiple dimensions into a single list
- Filtering results with conditional logic
- Translating nested loops into comprehensions
- Lexicographic ordering via loop structure

### Notes
- Built solution using nested loops first, then refactored.
- List comprehensions improve readability once logic is clear.
- This problem reinforces thinking in Cartesian products.


## 2026-01-04

### Solved
- Find the Runner-Up Score

### Concepts Reinforced
- Removing duplicates using `set()`
- Finding max and second max values
- Translating problem statements into clear logic
- Writing Python that reads like English

### Notes
- `set()` simplifies problems involving uniqueness.
- Removing the maximum allows easy access to the runner-up.
- This solution mirrors real-world data filtering logic.


### 2026-01-09
**Solved**
- Nested Lists (Second Lowest Grade)

**Concepts Reinforced**
- Nested lists
- Data extraction
- `set()` for deduplication
- Sorting with conditions
- Writing readable Python

**Notes**
- Broke problem into clear phases: input → extract → filter → output
- Python reads like plain English when logic is structured well
