## Earlier Progress (Initial Warmups)

- Completed early HackerRank Python warmup challenges
- Focused on input/output, arithmetic, conditionals, and loops
- Built habit of solving → reflecting → committing

## 2025-12-31
### Solved
- Python Division

### Concepts Reinforced
- Difference between integer division (`//`) and float division (`/`)
- Reading multiple inputs from STDIN
- Printing results on separate lines as required by the judge

### Notes
- In Python 3, `/` always returns a float.
- `//` performs floor (integer) division.
- Understanding operators prevents silent logic bugs.

### Solved
- Python Loops

### Concepts Reinforced
- Using `range(n)` to iterate from 0 to n-1
- For-loop iteration
- Calculating squares with multiplication
- Printing output line-by-line for judges

### Notes
- `range(n)` excludes `n` by design.
- Each loop iteration maps directly to one output line.
- Googling syntax is part of real-world problem solving.
