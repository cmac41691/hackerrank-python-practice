# 🐍 HackerRank Python Practice

## Overview
This repository documents my structured Python practice using HackerRank.
The focus is on problem-solving, pseudocode, and algorithmic reasoning
in preparation for backend development and technical interviews.

## Workflow
- Read each HackerRank problem carefully
- Break the problem down into pseudocode first
- Implement and test solutions on HackerRank
- Reflect on logic, edge cases, and patterns
- Track progress and lessons learned here

## Goals
- Reinforce Python fundamentals
- Strengthen algorithmic thinking
- Build confidence for technical interviews
- Maintain a clear record of long-term growth

## Notes
This repository prioritizes learning and clarity over speed or rankings.
